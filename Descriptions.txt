Single
a single is a type of release, typically a song recording of fewer tracks than an LP record or an album. One can be released for sale to the public in a variety of formats. In most cases, a single is a song that is released separately from an album, although it usually also appears on an album.
EP
EP stands for ‘Extended Play,’ meaning that an EP is longer than a single but shorter than an album. They typically feature between 2-5 songs and are under 30 minutes in length
ALBUMS
an album is a collection of songs usually around 45 mins in length and a minimum of ten tracks.  An album is a collection of songs or other audio tracks that are released together as a cohesive unit. Albums typically revolve around a central theme.
MIXTAPES
They have no restriction on length and are often just a collection of songs that generally don’t have a theme.
Compilation
A compilation album comprises tracks, which may be previously released or unreleased, usually from several separate recordings by either one performer or by several performers.
Cover
a cover version, cover song, remake, revival, or simply cover is a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song
Soundtrack
A soundtrack is a collection of recordings used in an audiovisual production like a movie or television series. It can be compromised of songs from a movie or it could be the score of a production.
Remix
A remix is a derivative work of another recording, almost always one that has been previously released.
